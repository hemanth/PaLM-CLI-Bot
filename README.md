# PaLM-CLI-Bot
> CLI Chatbot using PaLM API

This is a simple chatbot script that utilizes the Pathways Language Model (PaLM) library from Google Generative AI. The script prompts the user for input, sends the input to the PaLM API for processing, and prints the response.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, make sure you have the following:
- Python 3.x installed
- PaLM API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Install the required dependencies using the following command: `pip install google-generativeai halo`
3. Set the PaLM API key as an environment variable. For example, you can add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file: `export PALM_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"`
Make sure to replace `"your_api_key_here"` with your actual PaLM API key.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
2. Run the script using the following command: `python chatbot.py`
3. The script will continuously prompt you with `CLAI> `. Enter your message and press Enter.
4. The script will display a spinner indicating that it's processing the input.
5. Once the response is received from the PaLM API, the spinner will stop, and the response will be printed below the input prompt.
